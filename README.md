# soc

Soc (stream of consciousness) is a personal website platform for introverts. It is
designed to run a blog as well as a microblog.

This codebase is currently geared for my own site, but can be easily adapted.

# Development environment

Uses [devenv](https://devenv.sh). If you wish to run outside of this you should
still be able to use `devenv.nix` as documentation of what is required.

# Deployment

The plan is to use Kamal for deployment.
