# Summon Player

Summon player is a lightweight digital helper for tabletop games. It is designed
for use in a few situations:
- To use for theatre of the mind games alongside a video call platform
- To use alongside a platform such as Owlbear Rodeo
- For Play-by-Post games
- To manage in-person games

# Development environment

Uses [devenv](https://devenv.sh). If you wish to run outside of this you should
still be able to use `devenv.nix` as documentation of what is required.

# Deployment

The plan is to use MRSK for deployment.
